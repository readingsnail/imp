After far too long alone, [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetSheHe] decided to extend an offer of marriage to the [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').Custom('get_beautifulness')] [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').Custom('get_age_adjective')] [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen], of the [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] dynasty.
random_marriage_proposal_2코0=After careful deliberation, assessment of potential spouses, and a great deal of research into various bloodlines and heritages, [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetPraenomen] summoned [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetHerHis] aides, and issued an offer of marriage to [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen] of the [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] dynasty.
random_marriage_proposal_3코0=While [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetPraenomen] has enjoyed life immensely as a [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetWomanMan] of leisure, [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetSheHe] summoned an envoy this very morning to deliver a proposal of marriage to the [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').Custom('get_beautifulness')] [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').Custom('get_age_adjective')] [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen], hoping to produce heirs to further legitimize the [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] dynasty.
#Second
hof_disapproves_loyalty_desc코0=\n\nUnfortunately, the envoy reports, the head of the [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] dynasty, [SCOPE.sChar('negotiator').GetName], is a vocal critic of our rule, and has made it clear that [SCOPE.sChar('negotiator').GetSheHe] will not allow this union under any circumstances.\n\nWe suspect this may just be a keen negotiating position, although we will have to offer a great deal more than we had hoped, if we are to win the heart of the [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').Custom('get_beautifulness')] [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen].
hof_disapproves_age_desc코0=\n\nWith regret, our envoy brings news that the head of the house [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective], [SCOPE.sChar('negotiator').GetName], has stepped in to raise issues with this proposal, citing the great gap in age between [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetPraenomen] and the [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').Custom('get_age_adjective')], [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen].\n\nClearly, [SCOPE.sChar('negotiator').GetSheHe] is merely attempting to get more out of us for the dowry... perhaps negotiation is the only way to win love for [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetPraenomen].
self_disapproves_loyalty_desc코0=\n\nThe envoy who delivered the proposal, however, reports that he barely made it out alive after [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen] flew into a great rage, hurling a [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_arena_death_implement_glad')] with great accuracy, and nearly decapitating him. It seems that [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen] considers our suggestions with great contempt. We may need to sweeten the deal by increasing the size of the dowry.
self_disapproves_age_desc코0=\n\nThe envoy reports that the proposal, whilst flattering, evoked a great deal of amusement from [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen] and [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetHerHis] companions, who made no effort to conceal their contempt regarding the advanced age of [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetPraenomen].\n\nWe may have to consider yielding a sizable dowry if [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetPraenomen] is to find love at such a distant gap of age and experience.
self_approves_desc코0=\n\nThe envoy reports that the [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').Custom('get_age_adjective')] [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen] almost swooned after receiving the news. It may be that [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetPraenomen] and [SCOPE.sChar('love_target').GetPraenomen] are an ideal match.
hof_approves_desc코0=\n\nDespite the appearance of [SCOPE.sChar('negotiator').GetPraenomen], head of the [SCOPE.sChar('negotiator').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] family, it seems that all concerns were salved by the [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').Custom('love_object')] that [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetPraenomen] had offered up in support of [SCOPE.sChar('suitor').GetHerHis] proposal.
