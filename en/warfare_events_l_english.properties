warfare.1.t코0=The Sacking of {SCOPE.sP('temp_city_scope_warfare_1').GetName}
warfare.1.desc코1={ROOT.GetCharacter.GetName} has led {ROOT.GetCharacter.GetHerHis} men to glorious victory during the siege of {SCOPE.sP('temp_city_scope_warfare_1').GetName}. The enemy flee in disgrace, and all that is left is to decide on how to treat the residents within.\n\nNeedless to say, the spoils of war are likely to cause those back in {ROOT.GetCharacter.GetEmployer.GetCapital.GetName} to admire {ROOT.GetCharacter.GetPraenomen} greatly, but leaving such wealth in the hands of one {ROOT.GetCharacter.GetWomanMan} could cause problems in future...
warfare.1.a코0=Let the looting be gentle.
warfare.1.b코0=Let the men roam freely!
warfare.1.c코0=None shall hide!
warfare.1.d코0={SCOPE.sP('temp_city_scope_warfare_1').GetName} Delenda Est!
warfare.2.t코0={SCOPE.sP('temp_city_scope_warfare_1').GetName} Pillaged!
warfare.2.desc코1=After the siege of {SCOPE.sP('temp_city_scope_warfare_1').GetName}, {SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetName} let {SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetHerHis} troops run riot, resulting in murder, rape, and theft. The wealth that {SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetPraenomen} has gained from this evil act is beyond compare, and our advisors suggest that {SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetSheHe} is now one of the richest people in our land. Even deserters previously resident in {SCOPE.sP('temp_city_scope_warfare_1').GetName} are flocking to join {SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetPraenomen}.\n\nDespite {SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetHerHis} popular acclaim, we should consider punishing {SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetHerHim} for these dastardly actions.
warfare.2.a코0=No. Let it go.
warfare.2.b코0=Insist on an oath of allegiance.
warfare.2.c코0=Demand that wealth is split with the army!
character_events.43.t코0=The Return of {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen}
returning_merc_first코0=Many long years ago, {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetName} was sent out into the world with an army of {ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective} soldiers under {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHis} command.\n\n
returning_merc_siege_yes코0=Stories have been heard across our realm, of the many exploits and successes of {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen}; even the bards still sing of the glorious sacking of {SCOPE.sP('siege_loc').GetName}, in which {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen} is said to have routed the defenders almost single-handedly.\n\n
returning_merc_siege_no코0=Sadly, few stories were heard of {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen}, during {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHis} times away - indeed, few even recognized {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHim} upon {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHis} appearance at the {ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_court_type')}, however, {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen} assures us of the newfound tenacity of {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHis} resolve.\n\n
returning_merc_success코0=Tales of deeds and misdeed aside, {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen} has returned in good spirits, and with a sizable quantity of wealth. We ought to be wary of {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHis} newfound standing amongst our {ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_court_type')}.
returning_merc_failure코0=Unfortunately, the adventurer's life was not for {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen}, due to a number of military disasters, and several narrowly avoided mutinies. {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen} has come slinking back to {ROOT.GetCountry.GetName} at long last, where {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetSheHe} hopes to make a less adventurous life.
character_events.43.a코0=Intriguing.
character_events.44.t코0=An Exile Returns
character_events.44.desc코0=After many long years adventuring, {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetName} has set foot back on {ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective} soil.\n\nMuch to the dismay of our court, it seems that {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen} learned a little more of the ways of intrigue, than we had hoped. Upon crossing the border, {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetSheHe} issued a stark proclamation in support of the vile pretender, {SCOPE.sChar('supported_pretender').GetName}.\n\nLet us hope that we are able to soothe the mind of {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen} with honeyed words, or better still: gold.
character_events.44.a코0=Traitors...
character_events.47.t코0=The Heir Returns
character_events.47.desc코0=Muttered whispers have foretold the return of once-heir, {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetName}. Many years ago, {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetSheHe} left the {ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective} court, intent on forging a destiny in faraway lands, before returning to await the inevitable coronation that awaited {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHim}.\n\nEvents move fast, however, and whilst {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen} was abroad, the beloved monarch {SCOPE.sChar('old_king').GetName} passed away, resulting in the rise of {ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName}.\n\n{SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen} believes that {SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetSheHe} is the only true ruler our country deserves, and many, it seems, are in agreement.
character_events.47.a코0=To arms!
character_events.48.t코0=Fallen
character_events.48.desc코0=Envoys delivered the grave news today, that {SCOPE.sChar('dead_merc').GetName} has fallen, while pursuing a life of adventure beyond the borders of {ROOT.GetCountry.GetName}.\n\nWe are told that a cairn now lies in {SCOPE.sP('death_location').GetName}, where many visit to mourn the fallen warrior.
character_events.48.a코0=We are to blame...
character_events.48.desc_successor코0=\n\nThe mighty {SCOPE.sChar('dead_merc').GetPraenomen} once stood in direct succession to the {ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective} throne, and our people cry out in anguish that {SCOPE.sChar('dead_merc').GetSheHe} died so far from {ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective} soil.
