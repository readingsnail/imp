no_laws_on_corruption코1=Curiate Assembly
no_laws_on_corruption_desc코2=The Curiate assembly was a legislative body open to all those of patrician status within Roman society. Whilst it lost much power to the establishment of other assemblies, the symbolic votes it cast could carry much weight on matters of state.
lex_acilia_repetundarum코1=Tribal Assembly
lex_acilia_repetundarum_desc코1=The 35 tribes of the Tribal Assembly were composed of citizens residing in distinct geographic areas. It voted, like the Curiate assembly, on matters legislative; providing endorsement and authority on many decisions.

lex_cassia_de_senatu_desc코2=The military arm of the Roman democratic system, the Centuriate assembly was weighted by the material wealth of the soldiers of which it was comprised. The practical result was a particularly elitist legislative body.

republican_religious_laws_rom코0=Religious Laws
grant_religious_freedoms코0=Avoid Religious Mandates

lex_aelia_et_fufia_desc코1=A niche, but important law, the Lex Aelia et Fufia put an end to the practice of unfavorable omens ending political discussion. This limited the power of those responsible for taking the omens, allowing for more equal political discourse.

republic_integration_laws_rom코0=Integration Laws
lex_canuleia코0=Lex Canuleia
lex_canuleia_desc코0=Passed centuries previously, the Lex Canuleia confirmed the right for patricians and plebs to intermarry.

lex_papia코0=Lex Papia de Peregrinis
lex_papia_desc코0=This law set out to challenge false claims of citizenship, with the ultimate aim of deporting foreigners from Rome. Archias, the mentor of Cicero, was famously tried under this law, an act which caused Cicero to write his work, 'Pro Archia Poeta', in Archias' defense.
lex_licinia코0=Lex Licinia Mucia
lex_licinia_desc코1=This law instigated the investigation of Italian allies registered as Roman citizens, largely due to a populist trend in xenophobia. The passing of the act caused uproar amongst the Roman Allies, effectively banning them from acting as citizens.
lex_hortensia코0=Lex Hortensia

republic_citizen_laws_rom코0=Citizenship Laws
lex_aternia코0=Lex Aternia Tarpeia
lex_aternia_desc코0=Enabling magistrates to impose fines upon nobles and citizens was an early, but effective way of limiting the power of the nobility. Fines in the early republic were levied in livestock, but later amended to require payment in bronze, as stipulated by the Lex Julia Papiria.

lex_fufia_caninia_desc코0=A simple limitation of the ratio of owned to freed slaves that any man might possess, ensured that the a slave economy was still viable in the late Republic.

republican_land_reforms_rom코0=Land Reforms
cassian_reform코0=Cassian Reform
cassian_reform_desc코1=The Cassian reform was passed in the early days of the republic, setting the stage for Roman policy for years to come. By seizing all conquered land acquired during conquest, and selling it to wealthy patricians, war became a lucrative business.
lex_servilia_glaucia코0=Lex Servilia Glaucia

lex_sempronia_agraria코0=Lex Sempronia Agraria
lex_sempronia_agraria_desc코0=Proposed by Tiberius Gracchus, the Lex Sempronia imposed fines upon landowners who held more than an allotted portion of land, going so far as to demand the seizure and redistribution of this 'illegal' territory to smallholders.

gracchus_reforms코0=Gracchus Reforms
gracchus_reforms_desc코0=Wary of his brother's fate, Gaius Gracchus continued to pass a wide measure of social and land reforms, focusing on domestic justice and the appropriation of conquered land. The famous 'Bread Dole', instituted by Gaius, was the subject of popular acclaim.

testamentum_militis코0=Testamentum Militis

lex_porcia_desc코0=A vital law, enacted to safeguard Roman citizens against summary execution whilst performing military service, the various laws enacted by Porcius also prevented wanton and torturous punishment, and gave convicted citizens the right to choose voluntary exile over execution.
punic_reforms코0=Punic Reforms
punic_reforms_desc코0=The traditional reliance upon the landed citizenry became a significant weakness to the Roman military, during the Punic Wars. As such, the practice of enrolling proletarii and in some cases, slaves, to perform the duties of lower ranking soldiers or oarsmen, became vital.
marian_reforms코0=Marian Reforms
marian_reforms_desc코0=The Marian reforms drastically overhauled the organization and recruitment policies of the Roman republic.

republic_election_reforms_rom코0=Election Reforms
leges_genuciae코0=Leges Genuciae
leges_genuciae_desc코0=The Genucian laws had a variety of errata, however, the keystone tenets held that any politician was forbidden from possessing more than one office simultaenously, and furthermore, that at least 10 years must have passed after the date of his first election, until a magistrate was able to hold the same office again.
senatus_consultum_ultimum코0=Consultum Ultimum
senatus_consultum_ultimum_desc코0=Intended to safeguard the republic in times of desperate need, the 'Final Decree of the Senate', was a reform of the older system of dictatorship, whereby one man would receive absolute authority over matters of state.

lex_antonia코0=Lex Antonia
lex_antonia_desc코0=Proposed by Mark Antony, in the aftermath of Caesar's assassination, this law aimed to abolish dictatorship altogether, though was ultimately unsuccessful; perhaps paving the way for the dawn of the Empire.

republican_religious_2코1=Priestly Status

republican_religious_3코1=Deny Priests in Senate
republican_religious_3_desc코0=Religious interference in political matters is no longer desired; our holy men should be out amongst the people, bolstering them in times of need.
republican_religious_4코0=Senatorial Veto
republican_religious_4_desc코0=Giving the senate the last say on candidates for religious offices, allows us to use these important roles as poltiical stepping stones to higher positions. Sadly, this often encourages the less pious to seek appointment.
republican_mediterranean_laws코0=Maritime Laws
republican_mediterranean_1코1=Grain Shipment Law
republican_mediterranean_1_desc코1=Feeding the people has been a struggle since the early days of civilization. Actively encouraging traders to flock to our ports may help to sustain our growing territories.

republic_citizen_laws코0=Citizenship Laws
republican_citizen_1코0=Status Quo
republican_citizen_1_desc코0=The struggle between the lower and upper classes has long been a defining feature of our civilization. Whist it may be a mere platitude, confirming the rights of all free men as regards trials, conviction and debt slavery, will appease many.
republican_citizen_2코0=Slave Treatment Sanctions

republican_citizen_3코0=Cultural Primacy

republican_citizen_4코1=Manumittance Policy
republican_citizen_4_desc코0=It is time that we admitted those less fortunate, into the higher strata of society. The balance to be struck, however, is in reassuring the nobles that their superiority in status and autonomy, is guaranteed.

republican_land_reform_1코0=Interference Policy

republican_land_reform_2코0=Military Settlement Policy
republican_land_reform_2_desc코0=We must assign a portion of all conquered land to the veterans of the campaign who were responsible for acquiring it. As such, our hardy soldiers will continue to act as a means of peacekeeping, and no longer overburden our home territories.
republican_land_reform_3코0=Land Seizure Protocol
republican_land_reform_3_desc코0=For too long, wealthy citizens have been in control of excessive amounts of valuable land. By ordering the forfeiture of mines, farms, and strategic logistical supplies, we can redistribute them to better serve the state.
republican_land_reform_4코1=Seizure Amendments
republican_land_reform_4_desc코0=The extreme measures of the Land Seizure Protocol may not be quite as necessary as previously thought. By reaching a compromise with the nobility, they will grudgingly provide support, whilst retaining control over their own affairs.

republican_recruitment_4코0=Military Modernization
republican_recruitment_4_desc코1=This act proposes a drastic overhaul of the logistical and administrative divisions within our armies. Such an undertaking must not be considered lightly, but if we do not grasp the chance, our neighbors surely will.

republican_election_3코0=Shortened Terms
republican_election_3_desc코0=It has become clear that power promotes the worst aspects of mankind. In an effort to combat this creeping corruption, we should reduce the electoral term, ensuring that no one man wields power for too long.

foreign_exchange_law코0=Foreign Exchange law
