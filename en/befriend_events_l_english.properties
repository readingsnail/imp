befriend.1.desc코0=It is well known that [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetName] has been seeking a particular government office for some time.

befriend.2.t코0=Exotic Gifts

befriend.2.a코0=Only a tiger is sure to win [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetHerHim] over.

befriend.4.t코0=The Gladiator
befriend.4.desc_1코0=A previously unknown gladiator has recently risen to great prominence in the arena, drawing huge crowds and by all accounts putting on a peerless show.

befriend.5.desc_2코1=Our position offers many ways to publicly flatter [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetName]. Careful praise of [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetHerHis] deeds in the halls of government, and among the notaries of our country, will be sure to find its way back to [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetHerHis] ears.\n\nAlternatively, a lavish sacrifice in [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetHerHis] honor can hardly go ignored, and then again, few can spurn the gift of a public statue in their honor, particularly a flattering one...
befriend.5.a코1=Publicly praise [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetHerHis] and [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetHerHis] deeds.

befriend.6.desc_2코0=[SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetName] is the target of a brazenly outspoken critic who has been provoking [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetHerHis] ire for some time. It seems the loudmouth is protected by political opponents of [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetFirstName] and believes himself to be untouchable.\n\nThis could be an excellent opportunity to impress [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetFirstName].
befriend.6.a코0=This wretch has abused our hospitality too long.

befriend.8.desc_1코0=Despite our best efforts to encourage a friendship with [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetTitle] [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetName], it would appear that [SCOPE.sChar('friend_target').GetSheHe] was not convinced.
