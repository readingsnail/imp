ROMINTRO코0=#T Rome#!\nDifficulty: #Y Easy#!\n\nAs our game starts, Rome has begun to establish hegemony over surrounding tribes and cultures, sparring frequently with its neighbors. The second Samnite war finished mere months ago, cementing Rome's position as a local power. The looming threat of the Etruscans and Carthaginians requires caution, yet Rome's economy far exceeds its appearance as a territorially emergent state.
CARINTRO코0=#T Carthage#!\nDifficulty: #Y Normal#!\n\nCarthage has prospered for many centuries before our game begins, holding a number of coastal cities around the Mediterranean. Several subjects continue to pay them tribute, and naval dominance rests firmly in Carthaginian hands. Such a decentralized state is not without problems however, with care required in maintaining the loyalty of far-flung provinces.
MACINTRO코0=#T Macedon#!\nDifficulty: #Y Normal#!\n\nMacedon, whilst a highly militarized state, was never the richest part of Alexander's empire. The incumbent Antipatrid dynasty however, has spent many years improving the general infrastructure of the region, and combating any threats to their perceived right to rule. The other successor empires in the east pose quite a threat, and the possibility of large-scale war is always on the horizon.
EGYINTRO코0=#T Egypt#!\nDifficulty: #Y Easy#!\n\nPtolemaios' Lagid dynasty holds a firm grip on the incredibly fertile Nile delta. Having recently suffered a crushing naval defeat at the hands of Demetrios, Antigonos' first son, the Egyptian navy is practically non-existent. Nonetheless, the condensed economy of the Nile delta provides a fantastic income base for military reorganization. Care should be taken however, as the majority of the Egyptian population is of differing culture and religion to that of their Greek overlords.
SELINTRO코0=#T Seleukids#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThe Seleukid dynasty, headed by Seleukos Nikator, controls the largest of the successor states at our game's onset. Whilst this sprawling empire can summon up vast hosts of soldiers, the proximity of the Mauryas in the east, and the powerful Phrygian state under Antigonos in the west, can result in conflict in two entirely different spheres. The ruling class consists primarily of Greek nobles, which can often cause conflict with the various cultural groups within Seleukid territory. To add to this situation, a number of dependencies rely on Seleukid support, some with entirely contrasting agendas...
PRYINTRO코0=#T Phrygia#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nPhrygia is the most central of the successor empires, boasting a sizable army, navy, and economy. Antigonos himself is the oldest of the successors, and is viewed with distinct enmity by his peers and neighbors. With a large number of dependent states, Phrygia must balance a bitter diplomatic situation, disloyal subjects, and an ailing ruler, in order to succeed.
